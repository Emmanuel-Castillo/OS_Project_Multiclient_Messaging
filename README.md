# OS_Project_Multiclient_Messaging

This is my project for my operating systems course that implemented over a series of four homework assignments.
The main basis of the project is to perform a FIFO communication between two processes, a client and a server program.
The server will run and will create a FIFO for a designated client when it begins execution, and the client will be prompted to perform system calls.

Eventually, this project now supports multiple clients at a time.
This program is meant to run in a Linux-based system, and is developed in C.
